          <p>Hey, I'm Raiyan! I'm a student at the University of Waterloo, where I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering with an expected graduation year of 2027.
             I was originally born in Bangladesh, but I spent my first six years growing up in K≈çchi, Japan. In 2011, I moved to Canada, and it's been my home ever since.</p>
          <p>I have experience with programming languages such as C/C++, Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. My technical skills encompass AI/ML tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Numpy, and Pandas, and tools/technology like React and Figma for web development.
             I also have experience working in Linux Environments, as all my projects are done in Linux, as well as Git for version control. 
             In addition to my technical skills, I possess valuable soft skills such as leadership, adaptability, problem-solving, fast learning, effective communication, and critical thinking.</p>
          <p>Beyond technology, I'm an active person. I have a deep-seated love for sports like soccer, badminton, and track. These days, I enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee with friends, biking, and running. I also love playing rhythm games like osu!, SDVX, and Project Sekai, and others that give me a new challenge. I am also currently in love with Moonstone Island.</p>
